# Weight Loss Tracker

This is an android app that helps you track your calories and weight. You can calculate your TDEE, save meals you eat regularly for easier calorie logging and chart your progress, giving you what you need to make losing weight more efficient.

## Features

- **Simple and intuitive interface** - One of the main motivations for making this was to make a weight loss app with as simple a UI as possible, as a lot of apps on the market had very cluttered and difficult to use UI's
- **Optional security features** - You can use a passcode and/or biometrics to secure this app, or use none at all
- **Privacy** - Works offline and data is stored entirely on your device, nothing is sent to a third-party
- **Templates** - For calorie entries that you enter regularly, you have the option to save these for reuse in the future
- **Charts** - Charts to visualise your progress, not just weight loss but also calorie intake
- **Dynamic fields** - Allows users to track additional information (besides calories) i.e. sugar, fibre or iron

### Planned Features

- **Barcode scanner** - Using Open Food database, users will have the option to scan barcodes of food items
- **Detailed nutritional charts** - Bar charts for other nutritional information i.e. protein or carbohydrates
- **Data backup**

### Possible features

- **Charts for the dynamic fields**

## Installation

A beta version will be released soon and will be available to download on GitHub, but once the app has been tested more thoroughly there are plans to release this on F-Droid.

## Contributing

Again, once this has been more thoroughly tested there are plans to make this project open source.
